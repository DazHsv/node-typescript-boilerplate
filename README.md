# node-typescript-boilerplate

A Node.js project boilerplate with Typescript support and auto-reload.
Feel free to customize as you need it.

Use `npm run dev` to start a nodemon watcher over `src` files.

Use `npm start` to run your project without nodemon.

This boilerplate uses: 
* [typescript cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript) For TS files transpilation.
* [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) For auto-reload project on changes.
* [ts-node](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node) For execution of TS files.
